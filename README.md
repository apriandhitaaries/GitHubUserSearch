# Bangkit 2024: Android Fundamental Submission
<p> This repository contains the source code for my submissions to the Dicoding "Belajar Fundamental Aplikasi Android" course, from the first to the last submission. This course is part of the Bangkit 2024 Mobile Development learning route and can be completed at your own leisure. I strive to include the best practices of the Kotlin programming language and the Android framework into my project. </p>
